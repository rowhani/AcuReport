# AcuReport

AcuReport is the report generation module of *ACUSIM* software which creates pdf/html/rtf reports from custom simulated Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models. 

This is mainly written using **Python**, **LaTex**, **VRML**, and **Open Inventor** in *2010*. 

### Notes

- This is only part of the software that may not be used for any purpose and therefore, is *not stand-alone*. 
- The code is uploaded here merely to show my coding styles and skills.
- *Sample reports and outputs* are uploaded to give you an experience of how they look like.
